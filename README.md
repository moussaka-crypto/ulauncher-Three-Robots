My personal theme for [Ulauncher](https://github.com/Ulauncher/Ulauncher)

### >>>add screenshot later

## Installation (write different cases)

1. ```mkdir -p ~/.config/ulauncher/user-themes```
2. ```git clone https://github.com/moussaka-crypto/ulauncher-mitheme ~/.config/ulauncher/user-themes/mitheme```

Or just download repository, unpack, copy to ```~/.config/ulauncher/user-themes``` and rename folder to ```mi-ulauncher (or a name of your choice)```.

Should you wish to make your own theme, here is a link to the official documentation: [link](https://docs.ulauncher.io/en/5.15.3/themes/themes.html)
